# Java EE - Simple GH-Pages how-to.

The [gh-pages](https://github.com/javaee/website-template/tree/gh-pages) branch of this repo contains all the initial assets for a simple site that can be easily customized for any Java EE related project. The site will be hosted in a specific branch of the given project and will be generated by GitHub Pages.
Check [https://javaee.github.io/website-template/](https://javaee.github.io/website-template/) to see how this sample site looks like.

* Clone your project repo  
:warning: **Make sure the master branch of your project contains both CONTRIBUTING.md** (see [here](https://github.com/javaee/website-template/blob/gh-pages/CONTRIBUTING.md)) and **LICENSE.md** (see [here](https://github.com/javaee/website-template/blob/gh-pages/LICENSE.md) for the standard GF GPLv2/CPE/CDDL). Do not change **CONTRIBUTING.md**; if you want to have specific contributing technical guidelines for your project, we recommend to have those in a separate file. 

* Create the orphan _gh-pages_ branch that will host your site
```bash
git checkout --orphan gh-pages
```

* You might want to delete unnecessary files.  
:warning: In any case, **CONTRIBUTING.MD and LICENSE.md shoud be in both branches**!
```bash
git rm --cached -r stuff_to_delete
```

* Grab all the initial assets from this repo [_gh-pages_](https://github.com/javaee/website-template/tree/gh-pages) branch and push them to your repo _gh-pages_ branch. Make sure to not overwrite CONTRIBUTING.md and LICENSE.md!
```bash
git add *
git commit
git push --set-upstream origin gh-pages  
```

* Configure your website, edit [README.md](https://github.com/javaee/website-template/blob/gh-pages/README.md) (the main page) and [_config.yml](https://github.com/javaee/website-template/blob/gh-pages/_config.yml) which contains project specific values (project name, tag line, repo URL, doc URL ...).

* Test your site. Via your project 'setting' tab, you can get its URL and check the GH-Pages site build status.
